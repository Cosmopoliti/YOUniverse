# Prototype of the YOUniverse project

This is a prototype of the [YOUniverse](https://sonet-2017.github.io/YOUniverse/) project presented at the exam of the [Social Networking](http://bit.ly/polito-sonet) course taken at Politecnico di Torino.
It was made using the [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) framework and starting from the [Starter Kit](https://github.com/SoNet-2017/starter-kit) provided by the teachers of the course.

### Note
This project was created for teaching purpose. AngularJS and Bootstrap should be installed with `npm` or `bower` instead of being downloaded in a `lib` folder. Due to some limitations on the lab computers, this was not possible.
